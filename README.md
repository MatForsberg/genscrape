==========

JavaScript library that aids in scraping person data off of genealogy websites. This will essentially be half the functionality of [roots-search](https://github.com/rootsdev/roots-search); [gensearch](https://github.com/genealogysystems/gensearch) is the other half.

This is a work in progress. To be honest, I haven't even started coding yet (beyond what's already part of roots-search). It's all just in my head. There are some challenges to over come:

* [Testing](https://github.com/rootsdev/gen-scrape/issues/1)
* [API](https://github.com/rootsdev/gen-scrape/issues/2)
* [Schema](https://github.com/rootsdev/gen-scrape/issues/3)
* Time - I don't have much of it.

Due to the issues and restraints listed above, my current thinking is that I'll focus on a simple v1, which means node.js will only be officially supported if it doesn't require too much work.

Create an issue to request support for your favorite site. The following sites will likely be supported from the start because they are already written as part of roots-search:

* Ancestry - Person Profile
* Ancestry - Record
* BillionGraves
* Find A Grave
* FamilySearch - Person Profile
* FamilySearch - Record
* Genealogie Online - Person
* Open Archives - Record
* WeRelate - Person
