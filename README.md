genscrape
==========

JavaScript library that aids in scraping person data off of genealogy websites. This will essentially be half the functionality of [roots-search](https://github.com/rootsdev/roots-search); [gensearch](https://github.com/genealogysystems/gensearch) is the other half.

This is a work in progress. Development is in the early stages.
